### 👋 dear programmer 

when i wrote my codes, only god and i knew how it worked.
now, only god knows it!
therefore, if you are trying to optimize this routine and it fails (most surely), 
please increase this counter as a warning for the next person: 

```go
  totalHoursWastedHere := 254 // ⚠️🕰️
```


May your Goroutines be swift, 
your channels be unblocked, and your debugging prowess unmatched, 
fearless Golang adventurer! 
☕💻 Happy coding in the land of Gophers! 🚀
